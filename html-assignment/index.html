        <p>
            I am 26 years old, my birthday was a few weeks ago on September 29<sup>th</sup>.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have lots of interests such as:
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li>cooking</li>
                <li>reading</li>
                <li>writing poems, short stories and screenplays</li>
                <li>watching films/anime</li>
                <li>drawing</li>
                <li>yoga</li>
                <li>hanging out with my pets</li>
            </ul>
            <p>  I enjoy cooking different types of cuisine, and would like to try a recipe from every country if possible. My dream is to work in the film industry as an editor and one day make my own film, or write a best-selling novel.</p>
        <p>
            I currently work for the <em>Ottawa Hospital</em> in <abbr title="Human Resources">HR</abbr> as a Staffing Assistant. I like working in healthcare and helping my community, but I want to shift my career path into more creative industries.
