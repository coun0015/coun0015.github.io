        <p>Here is a list of some of the HTML tags I used to build my website:</p>
        <dl>
            <dt><em>Emphasis</em></dt>
            <dd>This is as straight forward as it sounds. I used this tag to highlight important information on my page that I wanted to stand out from the other text. This can also be used for a title, like my workplace <em>The Ottawa Hospital</em>.</dd>
            <dt>Body</dt>
            <dd>This really important tag houses all of the main information on my page, including any headers or footers. Also called a parent tag. The meat, not the potatoes.</dd>
            <dt>Blockquote</dt>
            <dd>The blockquote tag is a fun tag that allows you to embed quotes on your page. Just don't forget the cite tag!</dd>
            <dt>Title</dt>
            <dd>The title tag sets the title of the website. My website title is my name, so you can see that displayed in the tab within the browser. The title tag is outside of the body tag.</dd>
            <dt><mark>Highlight</mark> text</dt>
            <dd>This tag can be used to make certain text stand out on the page, similar to the <em>emphasis</em> tag or the <strong>strong</strong> tag.</dd>
        </dl>
